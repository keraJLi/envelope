# 💌 Envelope: a JAX-native environment interface

```python
# Create environments from JAX-native suites you have installed, ...
env = envelope.create("gymnax::CartPole-v1")

# ... interact with the environments using a simple interface, ...
state, info = env.init(key)
states, infos = jax.lax.scan(env.step, state, actions)
plt.plot(infos.reward.cumsum())

# ... and enjoy a powerful ecosystem of wrappers.
env = envelope.wrappers.AutoResetWrapper(env)
env = envelope.wrappers.VmapWrapper(env)
env = envelope.wrappers.ObservationNormalizationWrapper(env)
```

## 🌍 Simple, expressive interaction!

- **Environments are pytrees**. Squish them through JAX transformations and trace their parameters.
- **Idiomatic jax-y interface** of `init(key: Key) -> State, Info` and `step(state: State, action: PyTree) -> State, Info`. You can directly `jax.scan` over a `step(...)`!
- **Spaces are super simple**. No `Tuple`, `Dict` nonsense! There are two spaces: `Continuous` and `Discrete`, which you can compose into a `PyTreeSpace`.
- **Explicit episode truncation** supports correctly handling bootstrapping for value-function targets.
- **No auto-reset** by default. Resetting every step can be expensive!

## 💪 Powerful, composable wrappers!

- **Carry state across episodes** to track running statistics, for example to normalize observations.
- **Composable wrappers** can be stacked in any order. For example, `ObservationNormalizationWrapper` before vs. after `VmapWrapper` gives per-env vs. global normalization.

```python
envelope.create("📦::🌍")
```

let's you create environments from any of the above!

## 📝 Testing

- **Default (no optional adapters deps required)**: `uv run pytest -m "not adapters"`
- **Adapters suite (requires full adapters dependency group)**:
  - `uv sync --group adapters`
  - `uv run pytest -m adapters`
  - If any adapter dependency is missing/broken, the run will fail fast with an error telling you what to install.

## 🏗️ Installation

```bash
pip install jax-envelope
```
